// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// My solution:
function greet(name){
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
}

console.log(greet("Ryan"); // should return "Hello, Ryan how are you doing today?"
console.log(greet("Shingles"); // should return "Hello, Shingles how are you doing today?"
